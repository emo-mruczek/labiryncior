 ## TODO

yyyyyyyy what should I do

this is a temporary name ofc (or not if i decided so)

# about

so this shit is supposed to solve mazes
yeah basically

# how

by uploading a file with a pre-generated by external tool maze
(it should be solvable initially, maybe i will change it later idk),
parsing it somehow, solving using some algorithm and printing the result in terminal
maybe i will make a TUI later in order to learn shit

# steps

1. Set-up the project
    [ ] make a git repo and stuff
    [ ] integrate libpng with the project
    [ ] get libpng to compile with a basic main
    [ ] simple makefile, consider also justfile
    [ ] formatter

2. Importing the file with a maze
3. Parsing the file into the internal structure holding the maze
4. Solving the maze
5. Printing in terminal maze with the solution

# future ideas

- TUI
- real-time solving animation
- controlling the speed of the animation
- checking wether maze is solvable at all


# useful stuff and all
